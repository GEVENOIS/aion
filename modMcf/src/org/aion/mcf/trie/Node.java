/**
 * A Node in a Merkle Patricia Tree is one of the following:
 * <p>
 * - NULL (represented as the empty string) - A two-item array [ key, value ] (1 key for 2-item
 * array) - A 17-item array [ v0 ... v15, vt ] (16 keys for 17-item array)
 * <p>
 * The idea is that in the event that there is a long path of nodes each with only one element, we
 * shortcut the descent by setting up a [ key, value ] node, where the key gives the hexadecimal
 * path to descend, in the compact encoding described above, and the value is just the hash of the
 * node like in the standard radix tree.
 * <p>
 * R / \ /   \ N     N / \   / \ L   L L   L
 * <p>
 * Also, we add another conceptual change: internal nodes can no longer have values, only leaves
 * with no children of their own can; however, since to be fully generic we want the key/value store
 * to be able store keys like 'dog' and 'doge' at the same time, we simply add a terminator symbol
 * (16) to the alphabet so there is never a value "en-route" to another value.
 * <p>
 * Where a node is referenced inside a node, what is included is:
 * <p>
 * H(rlp.encode(x)) where H(x) = keccak(x) if len(x) &gt;= 32 else x
 * <p>
 * Note that when updating a trie, you will need to store the key/value pair (keccak(x), x) in a
 * persistent lookup table when you create a node with length &gt;= 32, but if the node is shorter
 * than that then you do not need to store anything when length &lt; 32 for the obvious reason that
 * the function f(x) = x is reversible.
