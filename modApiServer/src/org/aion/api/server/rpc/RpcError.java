 * Json rpc error object http://www.jsonrpc.org/specification#error_object
 *
 * Further support for rpc error code EIP https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/JSON-RPC-Error-Codes-Improvement-Proposal
 *
 * There are various errors you can get back from the API. Here we will detail what they mean, and
 * sometimes how to handle them.
 *
 * RPC Error Types: 1. Parse error 2. Invalid request 3. Method not found 4. Invalid params 5.
 * Internal error
 *
 * 1. Parse Error --------------
 *
 * What does this mean? The server had an error parsing the JSON
 *
 * What to do? Check the JSON you provided and ensure it is valid.
 *
 * 2. Invalid Request ------------------
 *
 * What does this mean? The JSON sent is not a valid Request object.
 *
 * What to do? Ensure that your request matches our JSON-RPC standard.
 *
 * 3. Method not found -------------------
 *
 * What does this mean? If you provide a method that is not a supported API method, this error will
 * be returned.
 *
 * What to do? Check the method you provided for a typo.
 *
 * 4. Invalid params -----------------
 *
 * What does this mean? The params sent do not match the expected parameters
 *
 * What to do? Ensure that your parameters are correct for the API endpoint you are trying to call.
 * Also, ensure that you have all the required fields.
 *
 * 5. Internal error -----------------
 *
 * What does this mean? There was an internal error when processing your request.
 *
 * What to do? This error is hard to fix from the clientside, many times it is related to database
 * lookups.
